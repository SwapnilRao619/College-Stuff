Hey guys.
Swapnil Rao here. 7th-sem senior from CSE(CY).

Both CSE(CY) and CSE(AIML) have the same QP, subjects and syllabus for 6th semester, except for a a couple subjects, so this compilation will benefit the both.

From what I saw, the subjects that are not there in this repository are:
CSE(AIML): Foundations Of Artificial Intelligence And Computational Agents, Machine Learning, Machine Learning Laboratory, DevOps, Big Data Systems (Check Big Data Analytics folder, U1-4 matches I have heard)
CSE(CY): Foundations to AI&ML, Cryptography And Network Security (It is there in 4th Semester folder), Cryptography And Network Security Laboratory, DevOps

However, please do note a few things:
1) We barely had any notes and did most of the studying from YT and TBs. These are NOT complete notes and the syllabus might not even match yours.
2) Please do not use this as the sole resource as it won't really help out if you study for the sake of marks. Learn from YT videos in the "Recommendations.txt" files so that you actually understand the topics.
3) Please do DM on WhatsApp ONLY if there's incorrect/missing content or you want to create PR by updating the files.
4) Notes for some units are not correct and might need some updations.
5) Refer to NoteRep for PYQs and I have handwritten notes for DAA, FA&CD and other subjects, but I don't have the time to scan 100ish pages (totally) which is why these are all digital notes.
6) Thank You And All The Best :)
