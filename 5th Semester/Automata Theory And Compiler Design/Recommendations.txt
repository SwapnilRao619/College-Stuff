I did write my own handwritten notes as it was a core subject which I wanted to learn for placements etc. in general. I have not uploaded that as I don't have the time and patience to click photos, compile and all of that stuff.

I had Sini ma'am as my teacher for this subject, she did an amazing job trying to help the students understand such a vast subject in a short span of time, so do feel free to approach her for doubts.

Would urge you to do the same as the PDFs do not have all the content for this subject.
