Hey guys.
Swapnil Rao here. 7th-sem senior from CSE(CY).

Only a few subjects are common between CSE(AIML) and CSE(CY) for this semester, so I would recommend CSE(AIML) students proceeding with caution, and referring to only the intersecting subjects.

Please do note a few things:
1) We barely had any notes and did most of the studying from YT and TBs. These are NOT complete notes and the syllabus might not even match yours.
2) Please do DM on WhatsApp ONLY if there's incorrect/missing content or you want to create PR by updating the files.
3) Notes for some units are not correct and might need some updations.
4) I do have handwritten notes for all the subjects but then they are over 100 pages altogether and would require a lot fo manual work. DM if you are willing to take up the scanning task.
5) Thank You And All The Best :)
