Please do let me know in case there's something missing/incorrect and we can try to ask my department juniors to raise PRs to keep the repository updated. I could convert this to a website or something but I'm sure it's just redundant work when GitHub is doing its job. With this, my 3-year-long notes-posting era has come to an end, and it was a good run. I have tried my best to document every subject, but the labile/new department tends to change subjects frequently.

Thank you!
