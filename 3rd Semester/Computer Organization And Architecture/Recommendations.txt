For this subject, we did not get complete notes as such for all the units and had to do self study from textbooks.
This link helps quite a lot too: https://backbencher.club/computer-organization-and-architecture/ 
However, I did write my own handwritten notes as it was a core subject which I wanted to learn for placements etc. in general. I have not uploaded that as I don't have the time and patience to click photos, compile and all.
I used:
1) Prescribed Textbook
2) Neso Academy
3) MIT Mysore YT lectures

Would urge you to do the same as the PDFs do not have all the content for this subject.
