Hey guys.
Swapnil Rao here. 5th-sem senior from CSE(CY).

Both CSE(CY) and CSE(AIML) have the same QP, subjects and syllabus for 3rd semester, so this compilation will benefit the both.

The link:
https://github.com/SwapnilRao619/College-Stuff/tree/master/3rd%20Semester

Please do note that it contains all notes for all the 9 subjects along with the manual for integrated lab course in DBMS (not sure if you guys have it anymore).
Heard that UI/UX Design is replaced by NoSQL, so you could maybe use the manual PDF for that instead.

However, please do note a few things:
1) We barely had any notes and did most of the studying from YT and TBs. These are NOT complete notes and the syllabus might not even match yours.
2) Please do not use this as the sole resource as it won't really help out if you study for the sake of marks. Learn from YT videos in the "Recommendations.txt" files so that you actually understand the topics.
3) Please do DM on WhatsApp ONLY if there's incorrect/missing content or you want to create PR by updating the files.
4) Notes for some units are not correct and might need some updations.
5) Refer to NoteRep for PYQs and I have handwritten notes for COA and other subjects, but I don't have the time to scan 150ish pages (totally) which is why these are all digital notes.
6) Thank You And All The Best :)
